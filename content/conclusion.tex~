\label{sec:conclusion}We have developed the generalized Wiener rational functions
$\tilde{\Phi}^{(s)}$ and $\tilde{\phi}^{(s)}$ as basis sets for expanding
functions defined over the semi-infinite and infinite real line. These
functions are direct maps of a generalized Fourier series on a finite
interval. On the finite interval, the generalized Fourier series can make use
of the FFT to speed up computations by relying on the properties of Jacobi
polynomials. This allows us to use the FFT for computations involving the
generalized Wiener functions as well.



We propose that the Wiener basis set is a meritous alternative to existing
spectral expansion methods on infinite intervals. The Wiener basis has a
tunable rate of decay $s$ for any $s > \frac{1}{2}$; changing the rate of
decay can be accomplished in $O (N \log N)$ time if $s$ is an integer, where
$N$ is the size of the expansion. This allows one to expand $L^2$ functions
that do not decay exponentially, which has been an Achilles' heel for Hermite
function or Sinc expansions. The Wiener basis also has a skew-Hermitian
stiffness matrix with maximum eigenvalue $O (N)$ which shows that the timestep
restriction for stability in solving time-dependent partial differential
equations is not too harsh.



We have shown that the generalized Wiener basis set has value for function
approximation and for the solution of differential equations. However, there
are still unanswered questions and possible areas for improvement. It remains
unclear how to properly make use of the ability to choose the decay parameter
$s$ for various problems. No doubt further exploration of applications will
provide insight. In addition, we have used the mapped periodic generalized
Fourier series as the basis functions of choice; as discussed in Section
\ref{sec:genfourier-antiperiodic}, there are alternative trigonometric
functions that have have dubious value on the finite interval that may prove
very accurate for spectral expansions on the infinite interval. The task of
choosing the `best' finite-interval basis functions to use for expansions on
infinite intervals also remains unexplored. More in-depth studies for function
approximation and the numerical solution of differential equations must also be
performed to properly ascertain any advantages the generalized Wiener basis set
may have over other methods. 



There is always a resolution problem on the infinite interval when expanding
in a finite number of basis functions; when features of interest run outside
the primary domain of resolution, it is often necessary to resample the
solution and translate the basis functions to recapture the necessary
resolution. To repeatedly accomplish this in an online manner can be
computationally expensive. The linear fractional mapping employed in this
thesis to take the unit circle to the real line could be generalized to devise
an algorithm to perform the translation operation in $O (N)$ computational
time. However, such a possibility needs to be researched.



The Wiener basis functions are derived from generalized Fourier series that in
turn are composed of Jacobi polynomials. Because of this, it is natural to
wonder if there is a provable relation between function regularity and rate of
convergence to parallel the polynomial convergence result from Section
\ref{sec:tools-approx}. This possibility also requires further investigation.


We envision application of the topics studied in this thesis to problems outside
the scope of general function approximation and spectral expansions. The
generalized Fourier series we have developed are useful in performing windowed
Fourier transforms since the weight function is a particular windowing
function. The surprising nature of optimal Lebesgue constants in one dimension
and beyond and the close relationship to Jacobi-Gauss quadratures is an area
that requires further investigation. The generalized Wiener rational functions
may be used as basis functions in infinite-element approximations, which couple
finite-interval and infinite-interval solutions. 



The problem of determining an accurate spectral approximation of a function on
an infinite interval is a task rife with challenges. Although we cannot claim
to have definitively solved any of the classical challenges that arise, we can
present the generalized Wiener rational function basis as a consistently
accurate and robust basis set for function expansions.
