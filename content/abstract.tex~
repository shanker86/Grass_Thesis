This thesis concerns the formulation and derivation of a
generalization of a collection of basis functions originally devised by
Norbert Wiener for function approximation over the entire real line. The
generalized basis set may be parameterized by the polynomial rate of
decay of the basis functions at infinity. 

In order to explore the possible utility of the generalized basis set,
we first investigate the applicability of the fast Fourier transform
algorithm to Jacobi polynomial expansions. We show that such
applicability is robust (efficient and accurate) for certain classes of
Jacobi polynomials. In addition, we explore the extent to which
Jacobi-Gauss-type nodal sets serve as Lebesgue-optimal interpolation
sets. We extend our results to two dimensional triangular simplices to
obtain the best-known Lebesgue constants to date to the author's
knowledge. 

Wiener's generalized basis over the infinite interval is a direct mapping of a generalized Fourier
series over the finite interval. Using the properties of Jacobi
polynomials and the generalized Fourier series, we are able to show that
the generalized Wiener basis set is $L^2$ orthonormal for any choice of
the decay parameter. In addition, we show various other useful
properties including fast Fourier transform applicability, efficient decay
parameter modification, and sparsity and spectral properties of the
stiffness matrix.

We conclude our investigation with a few examples pertaining to function
approximation and solutions to partial differential equations. Although
we do not claim to have developed a panacea for spectral expansions on
infinite intervals, we present the generalized Wiener basis set as a
strong competitor to existing methods.
