%
% Welcome to the Brown University Thesis style (BUTHESIS) for LaTeX.
%
% If your questions are how to use this, then you need to see BUPHDSAM.TEX
% BUMASSAM.TEX (Brown University MASters (or PHD) SAMple).  If you want
% to understand the \TeX nical aspects of how this works, the following
% code should be fairly well documented
%
%
% Comments:
%
% First, don't assume everything here is laid out in a way that would win
% prizes at a typography school.  I am {\em certain} that there's a great
% deal of grotesque layout.
%
% Secondly, you may notice the \LaTeX commands \@afterindentfalse and
% \@afterheading a few places in the text.  Well, when I put them in there,
% I knew exactly what they did.  Now, I'm a bit fuzzy.  As I recall, the
% \@afterindentfalse flag simply says 'don't indent', while the \@afterheading
% command sets up \everypar so that on the first paragraph after the heading
% it will not indent the first paragraph unless one has set \@afterindenttrue.
%
%
% Possible Enhancements:
%
%   - Creating an Endnotes.sty file would probably be good someday.
%   - it might also be nice to provide an argument to the abstract
%     environment in the case that people frequently want to format
%     the title of their document slightly differently there.
%   - It would be nice to be able to list multiple authors if necessary
%

% This routine is used to generate the title page for the thesis or
% dissertation.

% Graduate School.  This format will {\em probably} not change significantly
% in the near future.  Nonetheless, do not assume it is correct.  Get the
% guidelines from the Graduate School and compare layout.
% A note about the setting of \footnotesep: This is the parameter that sets how
% much space comes before a footnote.  I have set this to
% 0.75\baselineskip, which 
% works for doublespace but not for single spacing.  That's OK for now.
% the 0.75 
% however is guesswork on my part.  On the whole, I can't say that I
% know why this 
% command works.  I only have some vague inklings.
